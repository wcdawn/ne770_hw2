Two parameters that are often computed in the solution of the solution of radiation transport problems are the total albedo ($\albedo$) defined to be the fraction of incident particles which are reflected from a surface, and the transmission factor ($\transmission$) defined to be the fraction of incident particles which are transmitted through a medium. Write analog Monte Carlo programs to compute the albedo and transmission factor for particles incident on a slab with incident angular distribution given in Equation \eqref{eq:fofmu}.
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:fofmu}
  f(\mu) = (\beta + 2) \, \mu^{(\beta+1)} \qquad \beta > 0 \qquad \mu \in [0,1]
\end{equation}
